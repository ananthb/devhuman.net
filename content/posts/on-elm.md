[Elm](https://elm-lang.org) is _still_ a delightful language
for writing reliable web applications.

## Elm is for beginners

If you've never heard of Elm before, colour me green with envy.
I dabble in a lot of facets of programming.
I started my career as a web developer, in fact, but I've always
hesitated to call myself a "web developer". I'm not a UI guy.
I'd love to be but pragmatism always wins out for me, so I build
the smallest thing that gets the job done, and move on.
Elm helped me find a moment of bliss in web development where I found
little joy before. I'm still not much of a UI person, but give
me an Elm any day of the week.

## Elm is for debuggability

## Elm is for fun(ctional programming)

## Elm is straightforward(-ish)

## Elm might be dead

## Elm is forever
